<h2>About</h2>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>

<p>I'm Peter! I've always aspired to be a well-rounded professional. I made this to help me seek future experiences that will allow me to sharpen many skills at once so I can continue to improve as a graceful collaborator.</p>

<p>Through my experience in the Humber Web Development program, I expect to gain the tools required to build my own projects and begin a career as a developer!</p>

<h2>I am passionate about:</h2>

<ul>
<li>facilitating safe spaces for growth,</li>
<li>designing tools and experiences that improve society and the well-being of others,</li>
<li>sharing music and games that bring people together and create lasting memories.</li>
</ul>
