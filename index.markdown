## What is this?

This is my Markdown Portfolio's Home page.

The goal of this page is to display an understanding of the Markup Language.
It's great to see that this language is so "bare-bones", I can basically just ***write***.

```javascript
var userInput;

if (confirm("Do you like to code?"))
{
    userInput = prompt("Me too! What's your name?);
    console.log("Nice to meet you, " + userInput);
} 

else {
    console.log("That's okay. I can do it for you!");
}
```
