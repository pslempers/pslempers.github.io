## About

## Who am I?

I'm Peter! I've always aspired to be a well-rounded professional. I made this to help me seek future experiences that will allow me to sharpen many skills at once so I can continue to improve as a graceful collaborator.

Through my experience in the Humber Web Development program, I expect to gain the tools required to build my own projects and begin a career as a developer!

## I am passionate about:


- facilitating safe spaces for growth,
- designing tools and experiences that improve society and the well-being of others,
- sharing music and games that bring people together and create lasting memories.
